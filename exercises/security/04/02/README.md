# String Conversion Function in C, C++, and Rust

## Introduction
This repository contains examples of a function in C, C++, and Rust that takes a string as input and returns a new string where certain characters are replaced with their HTML entities.

## Screenshots of Program Outputs

The function in each language replaces the characters `&`, `<`, and `>` with their corresponding HTML entities `&amp;`, `&lt;`, and `&gt;`. Below are screenshots showing the output of each program:
