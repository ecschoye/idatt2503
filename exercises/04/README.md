# Exercise 4

## Task 1

Based on this example repository: [assembly-example](https://gitlab.com/ntnu-tdat3020/assembly-example).

- Modify the message to say "Hello World from Trondheim!"
- Make sure the message is written 3 times to standard error instead of standard output.
- Verify that the program writes to standard error and not standard output.
- The program should return an error code. Also verify this.

## Task 2

In C, C++, and Rust, create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where the characters `&`, `<`, and `>` are replaced by `&amp;`, `&lt;`, and `&gt;` respectively.

- Include examples and print statements within the `main()` function in each programming language to demonstrate the usage of this function.

## Task 3

Based on this example repository: [c-example](https://gitlab.com/ntnu-tdat3020/c-example).

Follow the instructions here to create a dynamic library and link it to the executable file `c_example`.

- In the function `another_function`, there is a typo. Correct this.
- Update the dynamic library containing this file.
- Run `c_example` again without recompiling `c_example` after fixing `another_function`.
- What is the result?
