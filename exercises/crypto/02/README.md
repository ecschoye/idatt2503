## Oppgave 1 - AES a little history 

### 1) The evolutionary history of AES differs from that of DES. Briefly describe the differences of the AES history in comparison to DES.

Before AES the main standard for encrypting data was a symmetric algorithm known as Data Encryption Standard (DES).
DES is a 64 bit block cipher, which means it encrypts the data 64 bits at a time. 
It was a result of a research project by IBM in the late 60s, and it resulted in a cipher known as LUCIFER. They decided to commercialize LUCIFER in the early 70s and a significant amount of changes were introduced. 
NSA, after being asked for technical advice by IBM, were involved in the development of the algorithm. It was then proposed for the new national encryption standard. It was adopted in 1977 as the DES.
In the late 90s it was clear that DES was becoming insecure. The key length was too short and the block size was too small.

Therefore, AES was the outcome of an open, international competition initiated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
AES was developed in a much more public manner than DES, where cryptographic algorithms were submitted from various contributors worldwide, including academia and industry.
AES was officially adopted in 2001 after an exhaustive review and public comment process.
AES was specifically designed to address the shortcomings of DES, with key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits and a block size of 128 bits, providing a much higher level of security.

DES was developed in a time when computational resources were limited, affecting the design of the algorithm. AES, was developed with modern computational capabilities in mind, resulting in a more complex algorithm.

### 2) What is the name of the algorithm that is known as AES?

Advanced Encryption Standard.

### 3) Who developed this algorithm?

The algortihm was developed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.

### 4) Which block sizes and key lengths are supported by this algorithm?

AES requires a block size of 128 bits. The key length can be 128, 192 or 256 bits.
