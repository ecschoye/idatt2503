##  4 c) Can the computation of the keystream be easily parallelized?

In CTR mode, generating the key-stream is highly parallelizable. This is because the key-stream is created by encrypting distinct counter values using a block cipher. Since each key-stream block is tied to a unique counter value and independent from others, you can compute different blocks of the key-stream simultaneously, without needing to wait for the results of previous blocks.


## 4 d) You intercept a message which is ecrypted by XOR-ing a key-stream generated by CTR, as described above, but with an unknown block cipher (not the one above). How could information about known plaintexts-ciphertext pairs be used to infer information about the key used?

In encryption using XOR and key-streams, like in stream ciphers or CTR mode, the plaintext is XORed with a key-stream to produce the ciphertext. Knowing a plaintext-ciphertext pair, you can determine the key-stream by XORing them together. However, this doesn't reveal the encryption key itself, as modern encryption methods ensure the key cannot be easily derived from the key-stream. Additionally, in secure systems, each plaintext is encrypted with a unique key-stream, preventing security issues related to key-stream reuse.
