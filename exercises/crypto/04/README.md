# Task 1 
## Factorize n = 275621053. You can assume that n = pq, where pâˆ’q is relatively small. Show your calculation steps.

### Understanding the problem

We are given n = 275621053 and told that it can be factorized into two factors, p and q, such that n = p*q.

It is also mentioned that p-q is relatively small. This suggests that p and q are close to each other.

### Starting point - Square root of n

Square root of n is a good starting point, because if p and q are close to each other, then they are close to the square root of n.

### Looking for p and q around the square root of n

Since p and q are close in value, they would be close to the square root of n. 

Looking for numbers around the square root of n and check if they are factors of n.

### Checking if a number is a factor of n

If a number is a factor of n, then n divided by that number would give a whole number.

Start from square root of n then work downwards because p - q is small. 

### Finding p and q

When finding a number that divides n evenly, we identify it as p.

Then we can find q by dividing n by p.


# Task 2

## a ) 

Good characteristics that make a good choice for q given p:
- both q and p should be large prime numbers
- both q and p should be of similar size but not too close to in value
- while q and p should be of similar size, they should not be too close to each other numerically
- avoid using well known primes
- use safe prime numbers (prime numbers of the form 2p+1 where p is also a prime number)
- ensure that q is such that (p-1)(q-1) has no common factors with e
- q should be randomly generated
